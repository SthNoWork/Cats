try to use less tokens and smartliy

Note:
Currently the functionality all works ill note the important one down:
1. Uploading picture will only upload after the admin clicks to add it wont upload to cloudinary if user isnt done
2. when editing to remove picture or just removing product currently it is able to do it fine deleting it from cloudinary. (most the time ai always break this so try not to break it)

TODO: 
Remove annything related to products and change it to cats since before its a shop
Add feature:
ADMIN:
add a button to use the current mode (how it works rn call it batch mode) everyone has shared descriptions and title

add a button to do (new) indivitual mode. Each picture can have different title description category etc everything that would fit indivitual pciture like on fb post yes?
so in batch mode admin can seelct a bunch at a time
in batch mode it does how it works rn.

in the indivitual mode it will go through each picture one at a time and add 

Public view:
Again remove stuff releateed to products to cats related yes?
In the all cats section add a button to view by batches or indivitual

BEWARE: it does not mean only show the mode that are batch and the modes that are indivitual so heres how it works

Batch mode sows how it works currently
+ indivitual ones ofc 

indivitual mode 

The batch mode will be displayed as

Mainonefirst.. nextpho. next photo. next photo. (only one thumbnail and description on the first main one. the rest will just be empty)
+ indivitual ones

make sure u can filter them by category

and ofc u can do styling animation or style the website however u want 
goodluck! rememebr its cat themed
